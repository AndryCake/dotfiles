# My dotfiles
### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
These are MY configuration files (*dotfiles*) for MY system. They may or may not work on your system and I most will probably not be providing any help. Most probably, best-practices have not been followed and conventions have been broken; this may be improved in the future (feel free to give me any advice). I will be adding more files as I config/rice more apps.
